# Welcome to my Secure Messaging App Repository!

This is an application that I created to demonstrate my skills in software development and security measures within the software space. The app is designed for secure communication between users, incorporating a range of security features to protect data and ensure privacy.

## Key Security Implementations

- **AES-128 Encryption**: Messages exchanged between users are encrypted using AES-128, ensuring that communication remains private and secure.
- **CSRF Tokens**: Implemented for protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **CSP Headers**: Used to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.
- **Password Hashing**: All user passwords are securely stored using robust hashing algorithms to prevent unauthorized access.
